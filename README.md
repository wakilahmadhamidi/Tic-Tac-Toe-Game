# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a Human Vs Computer Game created in python using Tkinter GUI.
# Rules of the Game
The game is to be played between two people (in this program between HUMAN and COMPUTER).
One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
The game is won or lost by Human or Computer in three ways: Row, Column, Diagonal
If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
If both win (designed in this game) then the game is said to be Tie.
